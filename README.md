# Total Breakdown

Total Breakdown is my first ever indie game project. It's basically a destruction simulator that lets you choose from a wide variety of weapons and destroy structures with realistic physics*. At this time there are two game modes: casual and challenge. Casual mode lets you break stuff with unlimited ammo. Challenge mode is all about getting the highest score. Gain points by making construction material fall on the green pads. Plan carefully because you only have a small amount of ammo to work with.

*Please keep in mind that this is a physics simulation game which can be pretty demanding on the CPU/GPU. Some entry-level PCs may experience lag.
